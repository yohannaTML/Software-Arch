# Subject 9 : Unclear Specifications
* 3 students were asked to deliver a collection of their favorite movies with a few infos (title, main actor, director, year of publication).
* Each one of them coded a class returning a collection of MovieInfos, but one offered an ArrayList, the second an Array, and the third a HashTable.
* Your software must allow the presentation of the movies in each collection, regardless of its type.
- Step 1 : develop the first solution as each student did (3 different collections), 
- Step 2 : unify it all by keeping most of the student’s code (don’t change the collection types)

# Software Architecture Project
## Subject 9 : Unclear Specifications 
#### 3 students were asked to deliver a collection of their favorite movies with a few infos (title, main actor, director, year of publication).
#### Each one of them coded a class returning a collection of MovieInfos, but one offered an ArrayList, the second an Array, and the third a HashTable.
#### Your software must allow the presentation of the movies in each collection, regardless of its type.
#### Step 1 : develop the first solution as each student did (3 different collections), 
#### Step 2 : unify it all by keeping most of the student’s code (don’t change the collection types)

## Solution
#### We use the Iterator Pattern
#### The graphical interface is done with JavaFX
